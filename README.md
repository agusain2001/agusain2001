# 👋 Welcome

Hi, I'm **Ashish Gusain**, an AI/ML Developer and Python enthusiast passionate about transforming real-world problems into scalable, intelligent solutions. I love building with **LLMs**, **AI agents**, and **data pipelines**—bridging backend engineering with smart automation.

## 🧠 What I Work On

* 🤖 **LLM-powered AI Agents** – Built agents for platforms like WhatsApp, YouTube, and Slack using OpenAI, LangChain, and FastAPI.
* 🗃️ **End-to-End ML Pipelines** – Cleaned, transformed, and modeled data using Pandas, Scikit-learn, and deployed models with Streamlit/FastAPI.
* 📈 **NLP & CV Projects** – Emotion detection from audio, WhatsApp chat analysis, and YouTube keyword extraction.
* 🚀 **Real-Time Apps** – Integrated APIs and deployed ML models using Docker, AWS, and GitHub Actions.
