# 👋 Welcome

My name is **Ashish Gusain**. I'm an AI Developer, backend engineer, and problem solver passionate about building intelligent systems that work in the real world. I love working on projects that merge **AI, automation, and backend engineering**—all with a practical purpose.

You might know me for a few things:

## 🚀 Creator of AI-Powered Projects

* 🧠 **AI Agents** — Built agents integrated with WhatsApp, YouTube, Email, and more using OpenAI, LangChain, and FastAPI.
* 🔍 **Data Pipelines** — Developed scalable data workflows using Python, SQL, and AWS.
* 🤖 **Chatbots & NLP Apps** — Created domain-specific bots powered by LLMs with memory and tool use.
* 📊 **Analytics Dashboards** — Built business-facing tools using Python, Streamlit, and Power BI.

These projects focus on delivering production-ready, backend-first solutions with AI at the core.
